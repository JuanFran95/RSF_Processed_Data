# Processed data for RSF SANS gelation study

This repository contains the processed datasets used in the analysis of time-resolved SANS measurements of regenerated silk fibroin (RSF) gelation. The dataset includes:

- baseline-subtracted SANS intensity profiles with error estimates
- - baseline-subtracted and normalised FTIR Amide I spectra (1600–1710 cm⁻¹)
- normalised FTIR Amide I band intensities (1620 and 1695 cm⁻¹)  and 
- ThT fluorescence time traces  
- turbidity (450 nm scattering) traces  
- pH trajectories  

All datasets are provided in CSV format and correspond to the source data used in the manuscript figures.
